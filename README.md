Initial Steps to link github and R. What I've learned 1st time with github.

1)	Create repository at github.com
2)	Copy url in clone/download
3)	In rstudio go to new project
4)	Version control..git..paste url
5)	Create project (opens new rstudio with directory name) linked to clone
6)	File new R script or new Rmarkdown
7)	Write some code
8)	Save is command S
9)	Now how to upload to github: (can use option + control + M) this makes into master OR go to dropbox: tools/ version control / commit (this will ask which you want to commit can pick and choose by clicking boxes of files *must ALSO add a comment)
10)	Click COMMIT
11)	Now it will do its thing, close this and then click PUSH button (puts it to repository)
12)	If working on different  computers, in rstudio go tools/ version control / pull branches (this will bring most recent)â€¦also way to merge.
13)	May have to delete old to push new document with changes to repository!! (can add new comments in at this point when committing)
