The dataset is related to house prices of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. I came across it in Kaggle's competition section. For more info:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

```{r}
data <- read.csv("~/Desktop/ames.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ',', stringsAsFactors = F)  #stringsAsFactors = F add this to read in as character strings instead of factors (even though many variables are ordinal), so can clean and engineer better.  
head(data) #see it loaded correctly
View(data) #see as dataframe

```


```{r}
dim(data) 
#see that there are 2930 rows and 82 variables.

str(data[,c(1:9, 82)])
#show structure of first 9 variables and then target variable (Sale Price)

```


```{r}

#found csv file that had ames data alreaady combined, but alternatively could bind the train and test datasets provided off kaggle. Link to download full: https://www.openintro.org/stat/data/?data=ames

data$Order <- NULL
#dont need order variable, no actual order

uniqueID <- data$PID
data$PID <- NULL
#keep ID's as vector, but going to remove from dataset.

dim(data)
#now are 79 explanatory variables and 1 response variable. still 2930 rows.
#these 80 variables focus on the quality and quanitity of physical attributes of the houses. Basically what a potential home buyer would want to know about a property.
#example questions are: size of lot, square feet? when built? number of bedrooms, bathrooms, garage, pool, finished basement? etc. 

```

####### use %% for new idea of topic ######

1. Check data characteristics. Is there missing data? 
%%Check for missing data! 

In checking for complete rows of data it is surprising to get the result that all 2930 observations have missing data. Upon further analysis of the variables can see that NA which is representing missing fields does not necessarily mean missing data. Can replace appropriate NA's with None or 0 instead to show doesnt have this element. Example being Alley, says NA when House does not have one connecting. For other results that may actually be missing can use mean or median values of remaining. 

```{r}

summary(data)
#There are 20 continuous variables related to area dimensions such as total square footage as well as individual measurements of basement, main living area and porch square footages. 
#There are 14 discrete variables describing number of items in the house such as bedrooms, garage capacity, kitchens and bathrooms etc. 
#There are 46 categorical variables both nominal and ordinal. Have a range of 2 classes for variable Street (gravel or paved) all the way to 28 classes for variable Neighbourhoods. 
#the summary statistics also give idea of range and/or frequency for each variable. 

sum(is.na(data))
#are 13960 NA fields, need to look further into this. 
sum(is.null(data))
#no null fields

missing_values <- data[!complete.cases(data),]
nrow(missing_values)
#see number of rows that have missing values, is 2930. Meaning all of them so something is going on, will explore further. 


????replace NA's in the data for each row with correct values. 
```

Condition of Sale: Normal or Abnormal..stick with just normal!!

```{r}

#to not complicate results going to focus on variable Sale.Condition that is 'normal'. The other 5 classes here are 1) Abnormal such as trade, foreclosure, or short sale 2) Adjoing land purchase, 3)allocation meaning two linked properities, such as condo and garage unit 4)sale between family members and 5) partial when new home was not complete yet. So in summary a normal sale would represent a more common typical transaction of a home. Eliminate any bonus or discounts potentially present in abnormal sales that is beyond scope of data. 

```





IMPORTANT:Explore Response Variable
ALSO 2. What is the correlation between the attributes other than SalePrice? 
```{r}

summary(data$SalePrice)


Need all of data to be numberic first!!! Then look at correlation. 
  
cor_data <- cor(data[,-80])
#correlation among other attributes other than response variable. 
#strong moderate or weak (0.8 above, 0.5 above, below 0.5)
cor_data

VISUAL
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
#use to plot 4 main correlations form above

Sample:
plot(white_wine$density, white_wine$residual.sugar)
plot(white_wine$density, white_wine$alcohol)
plot(white_wine$density, white_wine$total.sulfur.dioxide)
plot(white_wine$total.sulfur.dioxide, white_wine$free.sulfur.dioxide)

chart.Correlation(cor_wine, histogram=TRUE, pch=19)
#installed "PerformanceAnalytics" package to use chart.Correlation
#Another way to visual the correlation between variables. 



Graph the frequency distribution of saleprice.
hist(white_wine$quality, breaks=seq(2,9,1), col = 'red', main = "Frequency Distribution of Wine Quality")
#visual of histogram
white_wine$ratings <- cut(white_wine$quality, 3, labels=c("Low","Medium","High"))
plot(white_wine$ratings)
#maybe can work above line in for small visual of final sale price in 3 groups...see which is most popular. 
```


```{r}

```



```{r}

```

Remove outliers...under 4000??


*Total square footage (new vairable of ground and basement) to salprice..plot this fitted line
Scatterplot of Sale Price versus Total Home Area by Sale Condition (Ames Data)
```{r}

```

In selecting observations...could go further and eliminate homes without a basement!! or just look at one story homes..could also draw a simple random sample from remaining normal sales to build a final set. 
```{r}

```


```{r}

```

The nominal variable was created by recoding the number of fireplaces
into a simple Yes/No (1/0) dummy variable.
***neighborhood variable into their models by converting it to a set of dummy (indicator) variables. (one hot encoding)
```{r}

```

IMPORTANT 5. Normalize the data set. 
```{r}

#need data to all be numeric 1st!! this is top priority. 

normalize <- function(x) {return ((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))) }

wine_normalized <- as.data.frame(lapply(white_wine[,1:11], normalize))
summary(wine_normalized)

summary(white_wine)
#original data set for comparision.


```

IMPORTANT 6. Divide the data to training and testing groups. 
```{r}

#once normalized. 
set.seed(100)
wine_new <- sample(nrow(wine_normalized), floor(nrow(wine_normalized)*0.7))
wine_train <- wine_normalized[wine_new,]
wine_test <- wine_normalized[-wine_new,]
ratings_train <- white_wine$ratings[wine_new]
ratings_test <- white_wine$ratings[-wine_new]

#test to make sure all data was divided into 2 groups. And this is true.
nrow(wine_normalized) == (nrow(wine_train) + nrow(wine_test))
#split data into training and test by 70/30.

NOW NOW NOW
#can use algorithm to predict, have a train and test set. 


```


8. Evaluate the model performance. 

```{r}

accuracy, percision, recall

```





----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4)	Data Preparation and Analysis
a.	Load correctly
b.	Format, not duplicates, missing values, fields are uniform, dimensions
c.	Clean, mention summary and descriptive statistics as way to  draw insights from data…assist me in building a better expertise of the domain of features so I can for effectively look for patterns and relationships. 1st take. (can include, histogram, boplot, pairwise scatterplot to observe correlation, distribution of variables, skewness and potential outliers)
d.	Look at target variable of final sale price. For continuous variables look at min, max, mean, median, quartiles. Also since target variable of final sale price is continuous want to look at continuous house prices instead of individual house price ranges. 
e.	Transform data or normalize (ONE HOT ENCODING): In order to run models on data will need to transform it. Don't want string types to train machine learning models so need values to be numerical. Ways includes converting discrete to continuous variables (ex. One-hot-encoding, convert and create more columns). Another way involves creating dummy variables for categorical variables, such as assigning values of 0 or 1 to show if a 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}

```


```{r}

```


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5)	Feature selection:
a.	Optimize parameters by selecting and analyzing / build model (this case regression)
b.	Normalization.  (Xnew=(X-Xmin)/(Xmax-Xmin). Scale. 
c.	Use creativity to build new features from the input data. An example is total square footage (TOTAL BSMT SF + GR LIV AREA). Look for positive variables that might add value such as being near a park or negative variables that reduce value such as being near a railroad. 
d.	Compare feature selection from manual chosen vs algorithm selection.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------





```{r}

```





```{r}

```

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6)	Train and Test Algorithms
a.	Regression
b.	Random forest
c.	CART
d.	SVM support vector machine?
e.	Ensemble learning? Xgboost (use this for next section to try and improve results or random forest too 
f.	Lasso or ridge regression
g.	Neural network? Something new to try?? Thought was really interesting

•	Split into test and train sets so can use k-fold validation to compare models. (80/20, train, test, 10 fold
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}

```



```{r}

```

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7)	Evaluate
a.	Choose performance metrics.
b.	Avoid overfitting
c.	GO BACK part: PCA. feature engineering and using the statistical procedure of principle component analysis to reduce dimensionality & improve prediction results. Such as accuracy. 
d.	To evaluate performance can look at plot of actual vs predicted values, see a fitted regression line,  r squared statistical measure to see the level of variability the model explains, (A r^2 of 1 would indicate the regression predictions fit the data perfectly, I’d be looking for a low P value and high r^2 value combination to see if my regression model has significant variables). Can look at mean absolute error also. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}

```



```{r}

```



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8)	Results
a.	Look at statistical tests on results. 
b.	Precision, recall etc. 
c.	Look into reasons behind variables with most predictive significance. Discussion and application to housing market. Relate to relevancy and applicability to for other cities housing parameters. Features that are missing such as backyard size, economy of closest major city, proximity to public transportations, schools, etc. 

CONCLUSION - summary of what did and major points findings
